                            <p>Scooby Doo is the eponymous character and protagonist of the animated television franchise of the same name created in 1969 by the American animation company Hanna-Barbera.[1] He is a male Great Dane and lifelong companion of amateur detective Shaggy Rogers, with whom he shares many personality traits. He features a mix of both canine and human behaviors (reminiscent of other funny animals in Hanna-Barbera's series), and is treated by his friends more or less as an equal. He speaks in a slurred, dog-like voice. His catchphrase is "Scooby-Dooby-Doo!" </p>

                            <p>Velma Dinkley is a fictional character in the Scooby-Doo franchise.[1] She is usually seen wearing a baggy orange turtleneck, a short red pleated skirt (or in later episodes an A-line skirt, or sometimes shorts), knee socks, Mary Jane shoes, and most prominently, a pair of black square glasses, which she frequently loses. She is seen as the "brains" of the group.[</p>
